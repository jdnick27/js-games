# 2D Golf Game

A simple browser golf game. Aim the ball and launch it toward the hole on a flat course filled with hazards.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the home menu. Choose **Start Game** to play or read **About Game/Rules** for instructions. The game canvas will scale to your browser window. Use the left and right arrow keys to adjust the shot angle.
An on-screen arrow shows your current aim direction. Press the Space key once to start the power meter and press again to launch the ball. Try to land it in the hole on the right side of the screen.
Avoid trees, water, bunkers and hills along the way. The green around the hole is slicker, so the ball rolls farther. If your shot lands in the water hazard a penalty stroke is added and the ball is dropped on the side of the water farther from the hole.
Press **R** to reset the ball if you want to restart the current hole.

The game now features 18 holes played in sequence. Each hole has a randomly
assigned **par** value along with a distance from the tee. The overlay at the
top of the screen shows the current hole number, its par and distance. Your
strokes for each hole are recorded on the scoreboard shown on the right side of
the screen along with how many strokes over or under par you were. When the
ball drops into the cup the hole is complete and the next hole will
automatically load until all 18 are finished.

# 2D Golf Game

A simple browser golf game. Aim the ball and launch it toward the hole on a flat course filled with hazards.

## Playing

Open `index.html` in a web browser. The game canvas will scale to your browser window. Use the left and right arrow keys to adjust the shot angle.
Press the Space key once to start the power meter and press again to launch the ball. Try to land it in the hole on the right side of the screen.
Avoid trees, water, bunkers and hills along the way. The green around the hole is slicker, so the ball rolls farther.
Press **R** to reset the ball if you want to restart the hole.

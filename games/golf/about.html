        Use the left and right arrow keys to adjust your shot angle. The
        controls are inverted—pressing left rotates the aim right and pressing
        right rotates it left. Press the Space key once to start the power meter
        and press again to launch the ball. Try to land it in the hole while
        avoiding hazards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Press <strong>R</strong> to rehit from your previous spot. The shot you
        just took still counts and a penalty stroke is added unless the ball
        landed in the water or out of bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Press <strong>N</strong> to restart the current hole from the tee
        without changing its layout.

        The game features 18 holes played in sequence. Your strokes for each
        hole are shown on the scoreboard.
